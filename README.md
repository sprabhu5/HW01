# Testing-triangle-classification
A function classify_triangle() that takes three  parameters: a, b, and c. 
The three parameters represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
The function returns a string that specifies whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral, and whether it is a right triangle as well.
This project also has test cases to test your implementation of classifying triangles.  The goal is to gain experience using automated test tools and to think through the issues associated with testing a "system".
